# Sorting Algorithms

## Insertion sort
Like sorting cards in your hand.

__Time Complexity:__ O(n * n)
__Space Complexity:__ O(1)
__Boundary Cases:__ Maximum time to sort if elements are sorted in reverse order.
Takes minimum time (O(n)) if elements are already sorted.
__Uses:__ Used when number of elements is small. Can also be useful when input
array is almost sorted.


## Selection sort
Repeatedly find minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
Maintains two subarrays in a given array: sorted and unsorted.

__Time Complexity:__ O(n * n)
__Space Complexity:__ O(1)
__Uses:__ It never makes more than O(n) swaps and can be useful when memory write
is a costly operation.
